## NB-IOT (Narrow Band IoT)

NB-IoT also known as LTE Cat NB1, NB-IoT is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) radio technology standard developed by **3GPP** to enable a wide range of cellular devices and services

NB-IoT focuses specifically on

    -   low cost
    -   long battery life 
    -   high connection density
    -   excellent extended range in buildings and underground
    -   network security & reliability

NB-IoT uses a **subset of the LTE standard**, but limits the bandwidth to a single narrow-band of **200kHz**.
